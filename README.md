The Stargazing-Planner web app that helps users explore the night sky, view constellations, get space facts, and learn more about astronomy. This app allows users to check the best time to stargaze based on their location, and it dynamically updates constellation visibility depending on where they are in the world. 
This design works well on any device. 
The application finds the user's geolocation to figure out which constellations are visible in the night sky. 
Based on location, constellations and a brief description will be shown. As well as this, there will be a new space fact daily. 
To visit the live version of this app, paste this link into your browser - https://stargazing-planning.github.io/constellation-planner/ 
This applicaiton used HTML for the structure of the app, CSS3 for styling and JavaScript for functionality.
I created this project to combine my curiosity for astronomy with my growing skills in web development. It’s my first project of this kind, and I’m excited to continue improving it.
